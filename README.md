Airdrop-MultipeerConnectivity
=============================

MultiPeerConnectivity

With MultipeerConnectivity.framework users can enable communication between devices without internet connectivity. I believe this feature might enable developers to create a modem apps to share internet among devices too.

Requirements:
XCode 5
IOS7 Beta 3 installed on iPhone/ iPad (Mini also)
Wifi Network, all devices should be in same network.
Simulator and device also can communicate with each other but should be in same network.
